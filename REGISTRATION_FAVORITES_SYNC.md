# Registration to Favorites Auto-Sync Feature

## Overview

Added automatic synchronization functionality that automatically adds selected courses from the registration form to the user's favorites upon successful registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Registration Form Enhancement (Public/index.html)

Updated the registration form submission handler to automatically sync selected interested courses to favorites after successful registration.

**Key Changes:**
- After successful user registration, the system now checks if the user selected any "interested courses"
- Converts course titles to course IDs using the coursesData array
- Automatically adds all selected courses to the user's favorites using the `addMultipleFavorites` API
- Includes error handling to prevent registration failures if sync fails

**Code Location:** Lines 438-456 in Public/index.html

```javascript
// After successful registration
if (data.interestedCourses && data.interestedCourses.length > 0) {
    try {
        // Convert course titles to course IDs
        const courseTitles = data.interestedCourses;
        const courseIds = courseTitles
            .map(title => {
                const course = coursesData.find(c => c.title === title);
                return course ? course.id : null;
            })
            .filter(id => id !== null && id !== undefined);
        
        if (courseIds.length > 0) {
            // Batch add to favorites
            const syncResult = window.favoritesAPI.addMultipleFavorites(result.user_id, courseIds);
            if (syncResult.success) {
                console.log('已自動將 ' + courseIds.length + ' 個選擇的課程添加到收藏清單');
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('同步課程到收藏時發生錯誤:', error);
    }
}
```

### 2. Favorites Page Enhancement (Public/favorites.html)

Previously enhanced to show all 20 courses with the ability to browse and add/remove favorites.

## User Flow

1. **Registration:**
   - User fills out the registration form
   - Selects one or more courses they're interested in
   - Submits the form

2. **Auto-Sync:**
   - Upon successful registration, selected courses are automatically added to "我的收藏" (My Favorites)
   - User is redirected to the dashboard

3. **Viewing Favorites:**
   - User can navigate to "我的收藏" page
   - See all 20 courses available
   - Previously selected courses are already marked as favorites
   - Can add/remove additional courses

## Technical Details

### API Used
- `favoritesAPI.addMultipleFavorites(userId, courseIds)` - Batch adds multiple courses to favorites

### Data Flow
1. Registration form collects course titles as selected interests
2. Upon successful registration, course titles are mapped to course IDs
3. Course IDs are batch added to the user's favorites using the FavoritesAPI
4. Favorites are stored in localStorage and persist across sessions

### Error Handling
- Errors in the sync process are caught and logged but don't prevent successful registration
- Uses try-catch block to isolate sync errors from registration process

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience:** Users don't need to manually add courses they already selected during registration
2. **Time Saving:** Reduces redundant actions
3. **User-Friendly:** Logical flow from registration interest to saved favorites
4. **Consistent Data:** Ensures registration interests are reflected in the favorites system

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Select one or more courses from the "有興趣的課程" (Interested Courses) section
4. Complete registration
5. Navigate to "我的收藏" page
6. Verify that the selected courses are now in your favorites

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Option to sync existing favorites to registration data
- Bulk selection of courses in the registration form
- Export/import favorites feature
- Sync favorites across devices using cloud storage
